      <h3>According to NYC Planning website (https://communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov/brooklyn/2) , the population of Community District 2 (CD2) located in Brooklyn spends approximately 34% of their income in rent. Rent has been rising especially in these areas of CD2:  .</h3>

<h5> In a recent Community Board meeting, for instance, complaints were made surrounding the issue of lack of real affordable housing for the population of the area.'They say they will give us affordable housing, but in reality, the apartments are barely affordable at all.' said Celeste Staton, a community member at the meeting. 

Another community member, Tanja Richardson, expressed why she was against the construction of a new development at 570 Fulton Street, which theoretically would create more affordable housing units and shop spaces for rental:'Fulton Street doesn't have any stores in the end of the street, no commercial stores. And this story we are told that the new offices will create new jobs is not true. They won't create high quality jobs, and the offices won't hire normal level skilled people. It will happen just like in the Barclay's Center: they will hire now, and six months later they will let everyone go. Just like with 80 Flatbush, we won't get a good deal out of this.' </h5>

<h6> There are many reasons for the increase of rent in Brooklyn and other areas of New York, but one of the main ones in this district is gentrification. Over the past decade, after the financial crisis of '08, New York City managed to reinvent itsef, and created a record of 4.5 million jobs. However, the population of New York also grew, to an astonding 8.6 million people, pressuring demand for housing, and making prices go up, faster than many people could afford. The city ever since has been trying to reasses how to relocate those who can't afford rent in a certain area. For that, the government has thought of creating more affordable housing. In fact, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in 2018 that a new city project, 'Housing New York 2.0', will build and preserve 300,000 units by 2026.

 <h7> For now, however, these are the only developments with affordable housing currently in Community District 2 as of 2018: </h7>
